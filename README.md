This repo contains code and files necessary for plotting data from the 
Saanich Inlet ASV time series. It also extends to ASV-MAG mapping
procedures that link unique ASV 16S sequences to MAGs via homology.

Each .R file is a standalone script that will plot specific features
of this time series dataset. More code will be added as the project
evolves.

Several static tables are included that are needed for .R code.
